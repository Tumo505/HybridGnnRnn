Our approach achieved 97.18% test accuracy through progressive scaling, advanced regularization techniques, and a novel attention-enhanced bidirectional LSTM architecture applied to a comprehensive dataset of 230,786 cardiac cells across 7 time points.

## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Research Objective
To develop a robust deep learning model capable of classifying cardiac cell types from temporal single-cell RNA sequencing data, improving upon baseline performance and addressing overfitting challenges inherent in high-dimensional biological data.

### 1.2 Initial Challenges

- **Tensor shape mismatches** in complex model architectures  
- **Overfitting risks** with high-dimensional transcriptomic data
- **Scalability constraints** with limited computational resources

## 2. Data Sources and Acquisition

- **Genes**: 38,847 features per cell
- **Time points**: 7 developmental stages (day0, day1, day3, day5, day7, day11, day15)
- **Cell types**: 7 distinct cardiac cell populations
  - MES (Mesenchymal)
  - CMES (Cardiac Mesenchymal) 
  - CF (Cardiac Fibroblasts)
  - UNK (Unknown/Undifferentiated)

## 3. Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### 3.1 Raw Data Processing
```python
class ComprehensiveCardiacDataProcessor:
    def load_full_temporal_data(self) -> sc.AnnData:
        # Load metadata, count matrix, and gene annotations
        # Handle dimension mismatches and missing values
        # Create AnnData object for downstream processing
```

**Key preprocessing steps**:
1. **Data loading**: Matrix Market format (.mtx) with gzipped compression
2. **Metadata integration**: Cell annotations and temporal information
3. **Quality control**: Remove infinite/NaN values using `np.nan_to_num()`
4. **Gene selection**: Systematic sampling of top 500 genes for computational efficiency

### 3.2 Sequence Generation Strategy
```python
def create_temporal_sequences(self, adata: sc.AnnData,

                             n_sequences_per_cell_type: int = 1000) -> Tuple[List, List, List]:
```

**Temporal sequence construction**:
